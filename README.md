# Mashu
Mashu is a private moderation bot. \
If you wish to use mashu you have to host her yourself. \
I will not help you with self hosting but these are some requirements:
- An enviroment with nodejs(v14+), yarn and mongodb (preferably on a linux vps)
- A discord bot application
- Understanding of typescript (or javascript) since you need to edit some properties

If at least one of these don't apply to you and you don't know how to get it please save yourself some time and just get a moderation bot from [bots.ondiscord.xyz](https://bots.ondiscord.xyz/search?tags=Moderation)
